    <h2>About the tool overall</h2><h3>Who this tool serves best</h3><p>This tool works best if you have a financial aid offer to become a full-time, first-time student.</p><ul><li><b>Full-time:</b> you plan to enroll in the number of credit hours required to be considered a full-time student (usually 12 in a semester system).</li><li><b>First-time</b>: you have not enrolled in a college class for credit before.</li></ul><p>If you have enrolled in a postsecondary program before or you are planning less than full-time enrollment, you can still use this tool for financial planning. However, the following data points may be less accurate and/or relevant for you.</p><h4>Program length</h4><p>Going to school part-time may extend your program length. If you have previous credits that apply to this program, it may shorten your program length. Contact the academic advising office for help calculating how long it will take you to finish the desired program.</p><h4>Projected total debt, total cost of borrowing, and estimated monthly loan payment</h4><p>These estimates will not account for any student debt acquired during previous postsecondary programs. However, you can account for your current loan payments in the monthly budget tab of the “Can I afford my payment?” page.</p><h4>Graduation rate</h4><p>We use the 150% graduation rate, which is the portion of full-time, first-time students who successfully complete their program within 150% of the stated program length (for example, 6 years for a 4-year bachelor’s degree). College Scorecard provides a 200% graduation rate (8 years for a 4-year bachelor’s degree) that includes all students regardless of their full-time or first-time status.</p><h3>Privacy and data sources</h3><h4>Protecting your privacy</h4><p>This tool allows you to leave our website and return without any of your data being stored. It does not collect any of your personal information.</p><p>This tool saves your progress by capturing the numbers you’ve entered in the URL; as you proceed through the tool, a new URL will be generated.

Also, if you live on campus, your housing and meals will be listed as a direct cost that you pay to the school. If you live off campus or with family, these costs are considered indirect.</p><h5>ARE YOU CONSIDERED A DEPENDENT OR INDEPENDENT STUDENT?</h5><p>Allows the tool to apply the correct limits to your federal loans when calculating your projected total debt.</p><p><b>Note:</b> As mentioned above, this tool works best for full-time, first-time students.</p><h4>This year’s costs</h4><p>This page helps you estimate how much money you’ll need for the coming school year. We label this amount “Your estimated costs this year.” What this amount includes is explained in further detail below.</p><p>If your offer does not include costs, we supply the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard. This data has typically been submitted within the past 2 academic years, depending on the data collection cycle.We therefore recommend asking the financial aid office for more recent numbers.</p><h5>YOUR ESTIMATED COSTS THIS YEAR</h5><p>We break this total down into several parts, which are explained below. Some of these costs qualify to be covered by financial aid (grants, scholarships, work-study, and loans). Note that this total is an estimate – any numbers provided by the school are based on data they collected from students during previous years. Your actual costs may be higher or lower than this estimate, depending on your personal decisions about the number of classes to take, whether to buy used or new textbooks, where to live and how to feed yourself, whether to use public transit or a personal vehicle, and other factors.</p><ul><li><b>Direct costs:</b> Anything you will pay the school directly for. This includes tuition and fees – the cost of enrolling in the school and taking classes. It may also include books and supplies if your school charges you directly for them (instead of you buying them from a bookstore or other supplier), on-campus housing, meals if you buy a meal plan, and other charges like loan or student fees. These qualify for financial aid.</li><li><b>Indirect costs:</b> All other expenses not paid directly to the school that are related to your education. This includes books and supplies if you source them yourself, transportation, and personal/other/miscellaneous expenses (different schools use different words). If you will not live on campus, then this category also includes housing and meals. Ask the financial aid office what they include in this category, and make sure your qualifying expenses are included in their calculations.</li><li><b>Additional financial obligations:</b> Other personal obligations that do not qualify for financial aid, like car or credit card payments, or contributions to your parents’ household expenses. You should include them here anyway, so this tool can help you budget accurately. You should also check with the financial aid office if they qualify for financial aid.</li></ul><h5>ABOUT THE STATEMENT “YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR MORE AID”</h5><p>The Cost of Attendance is the total amount it will cost you to go to college each year. It is also the maximum amount of financial aid that you can be given. Including grants, scholarships, work-study, and loans, plus the Expected Family Contribution from your Student Aid Report, your financial aid must be less than or equal to the Cost of Attendance.</p><p>Cost of Attendance is defined by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, as tuition and fees, room and board (housing and meals), books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses. A standard Cost of Attendance is estimated by schools and should be included in your financial aid offer. Ask the financial aid office which specific expenses are included in the standard Cost of Attendance.</p><p>If you have qualifying expenses not included in the standard Cost of Attendance, you may be eligible for more aid. Possible examples include the cost of dependent care or studying abroad, expenses related to any disabilities you may have, and the one-time purchase of a personal computer. They do not include the purchase of a personal vehicle.</p><p>If you believe your costs will exceed the standard Cost of Attendance, ask the financial aid office about filing an appeal to have your Cost of Attendance increased. If your appeal is approved, you may receive more aid.</p><p><b>Note:</b> More financial aid can mean more loans – more aid does not necessarily mean more “free money” in the form of grants and scholarships.</p><h4>Costs not covered yet</h4><p>On most of the pages in this section, “Costs not covered yet” will appear in the upper right corner. This number is equal to “Your estimated costs this year” minus the running total of your funding. “Costs not yet covered” will go down as costs decrease or funding increases. Loan fees, also known as origination fees, are not included in your funding but they are included in your debt (see the Federal loans section of these technical notes).</p><h4>Grants and scholarships</h4><p>This page adds up the amount you are being offered from scholarships and grants. Most scholarships and grants do not have to be repaid. However, if you withdraw from school before finishing your classes, you might have to repay part of a grant.

A job will not be lined up for you. If you do not find a job, you will get none of this funding. If you do find a job, you may not get the full amount if your job does not pay enough or give you enough hours. Additionally, there may be a limit on how many hours you can work each week.</p><h4>Fellowships and assistantships (graduate students only)</h4><p>Some graduate programs offer fellowships and assistantships as a means for student to earn money for their education. These opportunities vary from program to program. Ask the financial aid office or program leadership for more details.</p><h4>Federal loans</h4><p>You must be enrolled in school at least half-time to qualify for federal loans. Your program type will determine which loan types you qualify for and your borrowing limits.</p><p>The cost of borrowing depends on the interest rate and loan fee.</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate</b>: In addition to repaying what you borrowed, you will also pay interest, which is calculated as a percentage of the loan. The interest rate is set each July for all federal student loans borrowed until the following July. The rate on federal student loans is fixed (does not change) for the life of the loan.</li><li><b>Loan fee:</b> A percentage of the loan that is deducted immediately from the loan amount. This reduces the amount received but not the amount that must be repaid. (For example, if the loan fee is 1%, then $10 will be subtracted from a $1,000 loan. You will only receive $990 but you would have to repay $1,000.) This percentage is set each fall for loans borrowed throughout the year.<ul><li>In this tool, loan fees are included in your total debt. They are not included in your total funding.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Repayment starts six months after you finish your program, withdraw from school, or drop below half-time enrollment (grace period).</p><h5>DIRECT SUBSIDIZED LOANS</h5><p>The Department of Education pays any interest accruing on your loans while you are in school (at least half-time) and during your grace period. This is the cheapest federal loan option. This loan type is available only for undergraduate students with financial need. Currently, the annual limits are $3,500 in year 1, $4,500 in year 2, and $5,500 in year 3 and beyond, with a lifetime total limit of $23,000. These limits are the same for dependent and independent undergrads.</p><h5>DIRECT UNSUBSIDIZED LOANS</h5><p>These loans are available for all students, regardless of financial need or program type. You are responsible for the interest that accrues while you are in school and during the six-month grace period after you leave or graduate. Interest accrued during school will capitalize – get added to your interest-bearing principal – when the grace period ends and you start paying back your debt.</p><p><b>Tip:</b> Paying down your accrued interest while you’re in school reduces the amount that capitalizes and therefore the amount of interest on your interest. If you make payments while you’re in school or the grace period, tell your servicer to apply them to your accrued interest, not future monthly payments.</p><p>Borrowing limits are higher for graduate/professional students as well as independent undergraduate students. Dependent undergrads can borrow as much as independent undergrads if their parents apply and are denied for a Parent PLUS loan.</p><p>For undergrads, how much you can borrow in unsubsidized loans depend on how much you borrow in subsidized loans. Suppose you are a dependent, first-year student. Your unsubsidized loan cap is $5,500. If you qualify for and borrow $3,500 in subsidized loans, then you can borrow only the remaining $2,000 in unsubsidized loans.</p><p>Depending on subsidized borrowing, the limits for dependent undergraduates are up to $5,500 in year 1, $6,500 in year 2, and $7,500 in year 3 and beyond. The lifetime total limit is $31,000.</p><p>Depending on subsidized borrowing, the limits for independent undergraduates (or dependent undergraduates whose family did not qualify for Parent PLUS loans) are up to $9,500 in year 1, $10,500 in year 2, and $12,500 in year 3 and beyond. The lifetime total limit is $57,000.</p><p>Graduate and professional students can borrow up to $20,500 per year. The lifetime total limit of $138,500 includes all federal loans for undergraduate study, with no more than $65,500 in subsidized loans.</p><h4>Loans from your state, the school, or a nonprofit</h4><p>Some states, schools, and nonprofits offer student loans, often through a bank or credit union. These are not loans that you arrange directly with a bank. Is that confusing? Yes! Ultimately, it won’t affect the calculations too much if you don’t categorize your loans exactly right. Regardless, make sure you shop around to get the best deal. Look at the terms: the interest rate, whether interest accumulates during school, whether you’ll have to start repaying the loan immediately after leaving school, and whether there are flexible repayment options.</p><p>Loan fees are included in your total debt. They are not included in your total funding.</p><h4>Other sources (not on your financial aid offer)</h4><p>This page lists other funding sources that may be available to you.</p><h5>PERSONAL FUNDS</h5><p>If you have savings for your education, think carefully about the portion you want to spend on this year’s costs. For a multiyear program, you may want to reserve some of this cash for future years.</p><h5>FAMILY CONTRIBUTION</h5><p>The amount that your family can contribute may be different from the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) listed in your financial aid offer. The EFC is calculated from your FAFSA. If your family is unable to put forth the full EFC, talk to the financial aid office about how they calculated the EFC and what your options are. These may include obtaining other grants and scholarships, borrowing more, or finding other sources of income.</p><h5>ESTIMATED INCOME FROM OFF-CAMPUS JOB AND ON-CAMPUS JOB (NOT WORK-STUDY)</h5><p>For the job income sources listed here, you may want to only include estimates for jobs that you already have. Depending on the economy of the school’s location, it may be difficult to find work. The financial aid office may be able to give you more information.</p><h5>EMPLOYER TUITION ASSISTANCE OR REIMBURSEMENT</h5><p>If you are employed and plan to keep working while you’re in school, ask your boss if they offer financial help for employees who are furthering their education. They may offer tuition reimbursement or other assistance.</p><p></p><hr/><p></p><h3>Covering your costs</h3><p>In the previous section you entered all the cost and funding information and kept a running total of your costs not covered yet.

Approval is based on the borrower’s credit history, but the credit check does not look at the borrower’s credit score or income.</p><p>Legally this debt belongs to the parent or step-parent. However, many students intend to repay this debt as if it were their own, so we provide an option for including the Parent PLUS loan amount in the total loan projections. This does not legally obligate the student to repay this debt.</p><p>The borrowing limit is the program’s cost of attendance, minus any other financial assistance received, including other federal loans.</p><p>The cost of borrowing includes interest and loan fees.</p><ul><li><b>Interest</b> accrues while student is in school. We recommend that Parent PLUS borrowers make payments while the student is in school to reduce capitalization – the addition of accrued interest to the interest-bearing principal.</li><li><b>Interest rate</b> is set each summer and remains fixed for the life of the loan. The amount borrowed each year will be subject to that year’s interest rate.</li><li><b>Loan fee:</b> A percentage of the loan that is deducted immediately from the loan amount. This reduces the amount received but not the amount that must be repaid. (For example, if the loan fee is 1%, then $10 will be subtracted from a $1,000 loan. You will only receive $990 but you would have to repay $1,000.) This percentage is set each fall for loans borrowed throughout the year.<ul><li>If you check the box to include this debt in your total debt projections, then loan fees are included in that debt. They are not included in your total funding.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Repayment starts 60 days after the second disbursement of the loan. For example, for a Parent PLUS loan divided between fall semester and spring semester, repayment would begin approximately in March. The Parent PLUS borrower can request a deferment while the student is enrolled in school at least half time, but it is not automatic. We recommend making payments while the student is in school to reduce capitalization – the addition of accrued interest to the interest-bearing principal, which results in paying interest on interest.</p><h5>GRAD PLUS LOANS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h5><p>Applications are accepted from graduate and professional students. Approval is based on the borrower’s credit history, but the credit check does not look at the borrower’s credit score or income.</p><p>The borrowing limit is the program’s cost of attendance, minus any other financial assistance received, including other federal loans.</p><p>The cost of borrowing includes interest and loan fees.</p><ul><li><b>Interest</b> accrues while you are in school.

The specific terms of each private loan can vary, and private loans are not always available. You should explore all grant, scholarship and federal loan options before taking out a private student loan. If you think you will need a private student loan, you have the right to shop around to find the best deal.</p><p>Unlike federal loans, private loans require a credit check. Borrowers may need to apply with a cosigner to meet credit standards or qualify for a lower interest rate.</p><p>The cost of borrowing includes interest rates and loan fees, also referred to as origination fees. Private loans usually carry higher interest rates than federal loans. Many private loan products charge variable rates that change over the life of the loan, unlike federal loans. Interest generally starts accruing while you are still in school.</p><p>Repayment typically starts after you leave school, and most lenders currently offer a six-month grace period. Some private loans programs require borrowers to start making monthly payments during school or right after graduation. Private lenders usually do not offer the flexible repayment options that are available for federal student loans.</p><p></p><hr/><p></p><h3>Affording your loans</h3><p>The previous sections helped you add up your costs and funding sources and then make a plan to pay for the coming school year. This section helps you check the long-term affordability of the debt included in your plan.</p><h4>Is this too much debt?</h4><p>For undergraduates, some financial aid commentators recommend keeping your total debt under the salary you expect to make your first year out of school. This recommendation is meant to serve as a guidepost to help you determine if you may be borrowing too much.</p><p>However, it is a broad generalization that doesn’t apply to every person or every situation. You should consider all your options before making a decision. This guideline is meant to assist with your decision-making process, not to dictate it.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you are considering a career in public service, you should explore the U.S. Department of Education’s income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which could result in lower monthly payments and eventual forgiveness of some federal student loan debt.</p><p>Here is more information on the debt and salary numbers we provide.</p><p><b>PROJECTED TOTAL DEBT</b></p><p>To estimate the projected total debt, we add up all the loans in your plan for this year (including loan fees). Assuming similar borrowing patterns, we also project your loans during the remaining program years, and then add it all together. We include interest accrued while you were in school.</p><p>This projection depends on the length of the program entered on the first page of the tool, “School & living situation.” It also depends on the type(s) of loan(s) you plan to borrow.</p><p>Here is how we make projections for different types of loans:</p><ul><li><b>Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans:</b> We assume that you will continue to borrow the same percentage of your annual loan limit.<ul><li>For example, suppose you are planning for the first year of a two-year program. If your plan includes 100% of the subsidized loan limit ($3,500) and 80% of the remaining unsubsidized loan eligibility ($1,600), then we assume for the second year that you will borrow 100% of the subsidized limit ($4,500) and 80% of the remaining unsubsidized loan eligibility ($1,600 again), for a total of $11,200.</li></ul></li><li><b>For all other types of loans</b> – including loans from your state, the school, or a nonprofit; federal PLUS loans; and other private loans from banks and credit unions – we assume that your borrowing will remain exactly the same for the remaining years in your program. In other words, projected non-federal debt equals this year’s non-federal debt times the length of the program.<ul><li>Due to the annual increases in costs, this is likely to result in an underestimation of your total debt.</li></ul></li><li><b>Accrued interest:</b> We assume that the interest rate will remain the same for the remaining years of your program. That is not necessarily the case – it is set every July – but we have no way to predict if it will go up or down. These rates are set by the laws governing federal student loan programs, including the Higher Education Act.</li></ul><p><b>MEDIAN SALARY OF THIS SCHOOL’S RECENT STUDENTS</b></p><p>This is the median earnings of students working and not enrolled 6 years after starting at this school.

Economic conditions regularly change, and your experience may be different.</li></ul><h4>What will interest cost me?</h4><p>To determine your estimated monthly student loan payment, we take your projected total debt from “Is this too much debt?” and calculate your total interest over a standard 10-year repayment period, which would be 120 months.</p><p>If you owe more than $30,000 in Federal Direct loans, you are eligible to enroll in the extended repayment plan, which can stretch the term of the loan from 10 years to 25 years. Lengthening the term will lower the monthly payment but increase the total repayment cost.</p><p>Also, federal student loans have other repayment plan options for repaying your federal student loans, including Pay as You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Based Repayment Plans (IBR), which are based on your income. Your loan servicer will notify you of your repayment options before your grace period ends. Also, you have the right to switch to another available repayment plan at any time during the repayment of your loans. Learn about other repayment options.</p><h4>Can I afford my payment?</h4><p>To determine your estimated monthly student loan payment, we take your projected total debt from “Is this too much debt?” and calculate your monthly payment (accounting for accrued interest) over a standard 10-year repayment period, which would be 120 months.</p><p>We then offer two different illustrations of this monthly payment.</p><h5>$15/HOUR TAB</h5><p>This tab estimates the number of hours you’d have to work to cover your monthly payment, if you take home $15 an hour. To take home $15 an hour, your wage would have to be higher; how much higher depends on what state you live in, how many dependents you have, and other details of your tax situation.</p><h5>MONTHLY BUDGET TAB</h5><p>This section shows large categories of typical expenses once you leave school. They are prepopulated with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Expenditure (BLS CE) Survey, based on the average expenses for someone earning your projected yearly salary and living in one of four broadly defined geographical regions in the United States (the Midwest, the Northeast, the South, and the West). The tool defaults to the region where the school is located, but you can change that if you plan to live somewhere else after graduation.</p><p>Categories of BLS CE data:</p><ul><li>Housing (includes utilities, cell phone bills, and house repairs)</li><li>Food</li><li>Clothing (apparel and services)</li><li>Transportation</li><li>Healthcare (includes health insurance and prescriptions)</li><li>Entertainment spending</li><li>Pension and Social Security</li><li>Taxes</li><li>Other (cash contributions, alcohol, tobacco, personal care products and services, reading, education, and miscellaneous expenses)</li></ul><p>We’ve added a line item for debt payments, in case that is part of your budget. You can change any of the default average amounts shown in the worksheet to better represent your actual budget once you leave school.</p><p>The tool then takes your average monthly salary (yearly salary divided by 12) and subtracts your estimated monthly student loan payment and other expenses indicated to estimate how much is left over at the end of the month. This may be a negative number, showing that your costs are more than your projected income.</p><p>Keep in mind that the expenses in the tool are for an average household, rather than an individual student. Your own expenses may differ depending on your age, family size, and other factors.

Here’s the definition of each of those statistics and why we think they’re important to consider.</p><p><b>NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND MOST POPULAR PROGRAMS</b></p><p>This information is included because program choice can affect your earning potential.</p><h5>GRADUATION RATE</h5><p>If you are going to school to earn more money, you need to complete your degree to get that payoff. The number we provide is the proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate within 150% of normal time. For bachelor's degrees, 150% of normal time is 6 years. For associate degrees, 150% of normal time is 3 years. For certificate programs it varies by length; for example, 150% of a typically 6-month program is 9 months.</p><p><b>Note:</b> <a class="a-link a-link__icon" href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/"><span class="a-link_text">Please visit College Scorecard</span> <svg class="cf-icon-svg" viewbox="0 0 14 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M13.017 3.622v4.6a.554.554 0 0 1-1.108 0V4.96L9.747 7.122a1.65 1.65 0 0 1 .13.646v5.57A1.664 1.664 0 0 1 8.215 15h-5.57a1.664 1.664 0 0 1-1.662-1.663v-5.57a1.664 1.664 0 0 1 1.662-1.662h5.57A1.654 1.654 0 0 1 9 6.302l2.126-2.126H7.863a.554.554 0 1 1 0-1.108h4.6a.554.554 0 0 1 .554.554zM8.77 8.1l-2.844 2.844a.554.554 0 0 1-.784-.783l2.947-2.948H2.645a.555.555 0 0 0-.554.555v5.57a.555.555 0 0 0 .554.553h5.57a.555.555 0 0 0 .554-.554z"></path></svg></a> for a 200% graduation rate (8 years for a 4-year bachelor’s degree) that includes all students, not just full-time, first-time students.</p><h5>TRANSFER TO GRADUATION RATE (2-YEAR SCHOOLS ONLY)</h5><p>If you are starting at a 2-year school in order to transfer to a 4-year program, this rate will give you additional information about the success rates of other students at this school. It measures the percent of first-time, full-time students who transferred to a 4-year institution and completed within 3 years.</p><h5>DEFAULT RATE</h5><p>This is a sign of how many student borrowers experienced financial distress while repaying their student debt. We provide the 3-year default rate, which is the proportion of student borrowers who defaulted on their federal loans within 3 years of starting to repay them, as a result of missing several monthly payments in a row (typically 9 for federal loans). It does not include defaults on private student loans.</p><h5>REPAYMENT RATE</h5><p>This tells you how many people from this school have earned enough money to start paying down their debt. This is defined as the proportion of student borrowers who have reduced the original principal balance of their federal student debt by at least $1 within 3 years of entering repayment.</p><h5>USING THESE STATISTICS TO COMPARE SCHOOLS</h5><p>In addition to seeing the school’s most recent statistics (if available), you can rank it against other schools. The gas gauge graph shows whether the school falls into the top third (green), middle third (yellow), or bottom third (red) of schools within each selected group.</p><p>If you are considering a 2-year school, it will only be compared to other 2-year schools. If you are considering a 4-year school, it will only be compared to other 4-year schools.</p><p>Here are the comparisons offered:</p><ul><li><b>In the U.S.:</b> This is the default comparison. It compares the school to all other schools in College Scorecard. For example, if you are considering a 2-year school, that school will be ranked against all other 2-year schools with statistics in College Scorecard.</li><li><b>By state:</b> Clicking this ranks the school against all the other schools in the same state. For example, if you are considering a 2-year school in Montana, this comparison will rank that school against all other 2-year schools in Montana.</li><li><b>Public/Private</b>: Clicking this compares public schools to other public schools and private schools to other private schools (including for-profit institutions). For example, if you are considering a private, 2-year, for-profit school, it will be ranked against all 2-year private schools in College Scorecard, both for profit and not-for-profit.</li></ul><h4>Review your plan</h4><p>This page allows you to review all the information you’ve seen and entered. This information should help you to answer crucial questions about whether you can afford this school, both this year and in the future if you are planning to borrow student loans.</p><h5>DOES MY FUNDING COVER MY COSTS?</h5><p>Look at “Costs not covered yet” under “Covering my costs.” If this number is more than $0, you may need to revisit your plan and find ways to either reduce costs or increase funding.</p><h5>CAN I AFFORD ANY LOANS I MAY NEED?</h5><p>The section “Affording your loans” offers a few different ways to evaluate the long-term affordability of the debt you’re considering. These include:</p><ul><li>whether your projected total debt is less than your expected salary</li><li>the estimated total cost of borrowing that debt on a 10-year repayment plan</li><li>the affordability of your monthly payment, including comparisons between the projected monthly payment versus a $15 hourly wage and versus a typical budget at your expected salary.</li></ul><h5>IS THIS SCHOOL THE RIGHT INVESTMENT FOR ME?</h5><p>If your school reports statistics to College Scorecard, we can provide information about available programs, graduation rates, and student success in managing their debt. You can also use this page to compare financial aid offers from multiple schools, line by line, apples to apples.</p><h4>What to do next</h4><p>The list of possible next steps depends on the type of program you selected. Remember that any changes you made to your offer in "Your Financial Path to Graduation" do not affect your actual financial aid offer or your ability to accept the original offer. You will need to contact the school’s financial aid representative and work with them to have your financial aid package updated if you’d like to make changes to your original financial aid offer.</p><p></p><hr/><p></p><h3>Save & finish</h3><h4>Saving and your privacy</h4><p>This tool allows you to leave our website and return without any of your data being stored.
