<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-1" id="52-a-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Application.</strong> The 25 percent limit in §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) applies to fees that the card issuer charges to the account as well as to fees that the card issuer requires the consumer to pay with respect to the account through other means (such as through a payment from the consumer's asset account, including a prepaid account as defined in §&#160;1026.61,  to the card issuer or from another credit account provided by the card issuer). For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-1-i" id="52-a-1-Interp-1-i">i. Assume that, under the terms of a credit card account, a consumer is required to pay $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. The consumer is also required to pay a cash advance fee that is equal to five percent of the cash advance and a late payment fee of $15 if the required minimum periodic payment is not received by the payment due date (which is the twenty-fifth of the month). At account opening on January 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account the $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. On February 1 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $100 cash advance. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge a $5 cash-advance fee to the account. On March 26 of year one, the card issuer has not received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment. Section 1026.52(a)(2) permits the card issuer to charge a $15 late payment fee to the account. On July 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $50 cash advance. Section 1026.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to charge a $2.50 cash advance fee to the account. Furthermore, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from collecting the $2.50 cash advance fee from the consumer by other means.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-1-ii" id="52-a-1-Interp-1-ii">ii. Assume that, under the terms of a credit card account, a consumer is required to pay $125 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit during the first year after account opening. At account opening on January 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge the $125 in fees to the account. However, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer to make payments to the card issuer for additional non-exempt fees with respect to the account during the first year after account opening. Section 1026.52(a)(1) also prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer to open a separate credit account with the card issuer to fund the payment of additional non-exempt fees during the first year after the credit card account is opened.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-1-iii" id="52-a-1-Interp-1-iii">iii. Assume that a consumer opens a prepaid account accessed by a prepaid card on January 1 of year one and opens a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by §&#160;1026.61 that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan on March 1 of year one. Assume that, under the terms of the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, a consumer is required to pay $50 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. At credit account opening on March 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $200. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge the $50 in fees to the credit account. However, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer to make payments to the card issuer for additional non-exempt fees with respect to the credit account during the first year after account opening. Section 1026.52(a)(1) also prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer to open an additional credit feature with the card issuer to fund the payment of additional non-exempt fees during the first year after the covered separate credit feature is opened.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-1-iv" id="52-a-1-Interp-1-iv">iv. Assume that a consumer opens a prepaid account accessed by a prepaid card on January 1 of year one and opens a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in §&#160;1026.61 that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan on March 1 of year one. Assume that, under the terms of the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, a consumer is required to pay $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. The consumer is also required to pay a cash advance fee that is equal to 5 percent of any cash advance and a late payment fee of $15 if the required minimum periodic payment is not received by the payment due date (which is the 25th of the month). At credit account opening on March 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account the $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. On April 1 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $100 cash advance. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge a $5 cash advance fee to the account. On April 26 of year one, the card issuer has not received the consumer’s required minimum periodic payment. Section 1026.52(a)(2) permits the card issuer to charge a $15 late payment fee to the account. On July 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $50 cash advance. Section 1026.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to charge a $2.50 cash advance fee to the account, because the total amount of nonexempt fees reached the 25 percent limit with the $5 cash advance fee on April 1 (the $15 late fee on April 26 is exempt pursuant to §&#160;1026.52(a)(2)(i)). Furthermore, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from collecting the $2.50 cash advance fee from the consumer by other means.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-2" id="52-a-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Fees that exceed 25 percent limit.</strong> A card issuer that charges a fee to a credit card account that exceeds the 25 percent limit complies with §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) if the card issuer waives or removes the fee and any associated interest charges or credits the account for an amount equal to the fee and any associated interest charges within a reasonable amount of time but no later than the end of the billing cycle following the billing cycle during which the fee was charged. For example, assuming the facts in the example in comment 52(a)(1)-1.i above, the card issuer complies with §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) if the card issuer charged the $2.50 cash advance fee to the account on July 15 of year one but waived or removed the fee or credited the account for $2.50 (plus any interest charges on that $2.50) at the end of the billing cycle.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-3" id="52-a-1-Interp-3">3. <strong>Changes in credit limit during first year.</strong></p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-3-i" id="52-a-1-Interp-3-i">i. <strong>Increases in credit limit.</strong> If a card issuer increases the credit limit during the first year after the account is opened, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees that would otherwise be prohibited (such as a fee for increasing the credit limit). For example, assume that, at account opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit card account is $400 and the consumer is required to pay $100 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. On July 1, the card issuer increases the credit limit for the account to $600. Section 1026.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees based on the increased credit limit.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-3-ii" id="52-a-1-Interp-3-ii">ii. <strong>Decreases in credit limit.</strong> If a card issuer decreases the credit limit during the first year after the account is opened, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove any fees charged to the account that exceed 25 percent of the reduced credit limit or to credit the account for an amount equal to any fees the consumer was required to pay with respect to the account that exceed 25 percent of the reduced credit limit within a reasonable amount of time but no later than the end of the billing cycle following the billing cycle during which the credit limit was reduced. For example, assume that, at account opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit card account is $1,000 and the consumer is required to pay $250 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. The billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. On July 30, the card issuer decreases the credit limit for the account to $600. Section 1026.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove $100 in fees from the account or to credit the account for an amount equal to $100 within a reasonable amount of time but no later than August 31.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-4-i" id="52-a-1-Interp-4-i">i. <em>Methods of compliance.</em> For purposes of §&#160;1026.52(a)(1), an account is considered open no earlier than the date on which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in transactions. A card issuer may consider an account open for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) on any of the following dates:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-4-i-A" id="52-a-1-Interp-4-i-A">A. The date the account is first used by the consumer for a transaction (such as when an account is established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-4-i-B" id="52-a-1-Interp-4-i-B">B. The date the consumer complies with any reasonable activation procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use of a new account (such as requiring the consumer to provide information that verifies his or her identity), provided that the account may be used for transactions on that date.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-4-i-C" id="52-a-1-Interp-4-i-C">C. The date that is seven days after the card issuer mails or delivers to the consumer account-opening disclosures that comply with §&#160;1026.6, provided that the consumer may use the account for transactions after complying with any reasonable activation procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use of the new account (such as requiring the consumer to provide information that verifies his or her identity). If a card issuer has reasonable procedures designed to ensure that account-opening disclosures that comply with §&#160;1026.6 are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than a certain number of days after the card issuer establishes the account, the card issuer may add that number of days to the seven-day period for purposes of determining the date on which the account was opened.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-4-ii" id="52-a-1-Interp-4-ii">ii. <strong>Examples.</strong> </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-4-ii-A" id="52-a-1-Interp-4-ii-A">A. Assume that, on July 1 of year one, a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services and a $500 transaction is charged to the account by the consumer. The card issuer may consider the account open on July 1 of year one for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(a)(1). Accordingly, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 1 of year two.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-4-ii-B" id="52-a-1-Interp-4-ii-B">B. Assume that, on July 1 of year one, a card issuer approves a consumer's application for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan and establishes the account on its internal systems. On July 5, the card issuer mails or delivers to the consumer account-opening disclosures that comply with §&#160;1026.6. If the consumer may use the account for transactions on the date the consumer complies with any reasonable procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use, the card issuer may consider the account open on July 12 of year one for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(a)(1). Accordingly, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 12 of year two.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="52-a-1-Interp-4-ii-C" id="52-a-1-Interp-4-ii-C">C. Same facts as in paragraph B above except that the card issuer has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that account-opening disclosures that comply with §&#160;1026.6 are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than three days after an account is established on its systems. If the consumer may use the account for transactions on the date the consumer complies with any reasonable procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use, the card issuer may consider the account open on July 11 of year one for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(a)(1). Accordingly, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 11 of year two. However, if the consumer uses the account for a transaction or complies with the card issuer's reasonable procedures for preventing fraud or unauthorized use on July 8 of year one, the card issuer may, at its option, consider the account open on that date for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) and §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) therefore ceases to apply to the account on July 8 of year two.</p>

For example, §&#160;1026.52(a) applies to:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-2-Interp-1-i" id="52-a-2-Interp-1-i">i.

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-a-2-Interp-2-i" id="52-a-2-Interp-2-i">i. Except as provided in §&#160;1026.52(a)(2), any fee or charge imposed on the covered separate credit feature, other than a charge attributable to a periodic interest rate, during the first year after account opening that the card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay in connection with the credit feature, and</p>

See §&#160;1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (E) and related commentary regarding fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that are not charges imposed as part of the plan under §&#160;1026.6(b)(3) with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and non-covered separate credit features as those terms are defined in §&#160;1026.61.</p>

For example, §&#160;1026.52(a) generally does not apply to fees for making an expedited payment (to the extent permitted by §&#160;1026.10(e)), fees for optional services (such as travel insurance), fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card, or statement reproduction fees.</p>

In contrast, however, a security deposit is not subject to the 25 percent limit in §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) if it is not charged to the account. For example, §&#160;1026.52(a)(1) does not prohibit a card issuer from requiring a consumer to provide funds at account opening pledged as security for the account that exceed 25 percent of the credit limit at account opening so long as those funds are not obtained from the account.</p>

For example, assume that a late fee will be imposed by the card issuer if the covered separate credit feature becomes delinquent or if a payment is not received by a particular date. This fee is subject to §&#160;1026.52(b) regardless of whether the fee is imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account or on the separate credit feature.</p>

Instead, for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(i), a card issuer must have determined that a fee for violating the terms or other requirements of an account represents a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of that type of violation. A card issuer may make a single determination for all of its credit card portfolios or may make separate determinations for each portfolio. The factors relevant to this determination include:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-b-1-i-Interp-1-i" id="52-b-1-i-Interp-1-i">i. The number of violations of a particular type experienced by the card issuer during a prior period of reasonable length (for example, a period of twelve months).</p>

At the card issuer's option, reasonable estimates for an upcoming period of changes in the number of violations of that type, the resulting costs, and the number of fees that the card issuer will be unable to collect. <strong>See</strong> illustrative examples in comments 52(b)(1)(i)-6 through -9.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-b-1-i-Interp-2-i" id="52-b-1-i-Interp-2-i">i. Losses and associated costs (including the cost of holding reserves against potential losses and the cost of funding delinquent accounts).</p>

Costs associated with evaluating whether consumers who have not violated the terms or other requirements of an account are likely to do so in the future (such as the costs associated with underwriting new accounts). However, once a violation of the terms or other requirements of an account has occurred, the costs associated with preventing additional violations for a reasonable period of time are costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of violations of the terms or other requirements of an account for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(i).</p>

For example, if a card issuer is charged a specific amount by a third party for each returned payment, that amount is a cost incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments. However, if the amount is charged to the card issuer by an affiliate or subsidiary of the card issuer, the card issuer must have determined that the charge represents a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the affiliate or subsidiary as a result of the type of violation. For example, if an affiliate of a card issuer provides collection services to the card issuer on delinquent accounts, the card issuer must have determined that the amounts charged to the card issuer by the affiliate for such services represent a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the affiliate as a result of late payments.</p>

Fees that the card issuer is unable to collect include fees imposed on accounts that have been charged off by the card issuer, fees that have been discharged in bankruptcy, and fees that the card issuer is required to waive in order to comply with a legal requirement (such as a requirement imposed by 12 CFR Part 1026 or 50 U.S.C. app. 527). However, fees that the card issuer chooses not to impose or chooses not to collect (such as fees the card issuer chooses to waive at the request of the consumer or under a workout or temporary hardship arrangement) are not relevant for purposes of this determination. <em>See</em> illustrative examples in comments 52(b)(2)(i)-6 through -9.</p>

Consistent with §&#160;1026.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. A required minimum periodic payment of $30 is due on August 25. On August 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on August 26. On August 30, the card issuer receives a $30 payment. On September 10, a transaction causes the account balance to increase to $1,150, which exceeds the account's $1,000 credit limit. On September 11, a second transaction increases the account balance to $1,350. On September 23, the card issuer receives the $50 required minimum periodic payment due on September 25, which reduces the account balance to $1,300. On September 30, the card issuer imposes a $25 over-the-limit fee, consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On October 26, a late payment has occurred because the $60 required minimum periodic payment due on October 25 has not been received. Accordingly, consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card issuer imposes a $35 late payment fee on October 26.</p>

On July 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on July 26. On July 30, the card issuer receives a $50 payment. A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on August 25. On August 24, a $50 payment is received. On August 27, the $50 payment is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds. In these circumstances, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(ii) permits the card issuer to impose either a late payment fee or a returned payment fee but not both because the late payment and the returned payment result from the same event or transaction. Accordingly, for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii), the event or transaction constitutes a single violation. However, if the card issuer imposes a late payment fee, §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) permits the issuer to impose a fee of $35 because the late payment occurred during the six billing cycles following the July billing cycle. In contrast, if the card issuer imposes a returned payment fee, the amount of the fee may be no more than $25 pursuant to §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A).</p>

For purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the delinquent balance is any previously billed amount that remains unpaid at the time the late payment fee is imposed pursuant to §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C).

During the July billing cycle, the account is used for $300 in transactions, increasing the balance to $1,300. At the end of the July billing cycle, no payment has been received and the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On August 5, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing the $1,325 balance consistent with §&#160;1026.7. During the August billing cycle, the account is used for $200 in transactions, increasing the balance to $1,525. At the end of the August billing cycle, no payment has been received. Consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $40, which is 3% of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle.

However, if a payment has been returned and is submitted again for payment by the card issuer, there is no additional dollar amount associated with a subsequent return of that payment and §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an additional returned payment fee.

Same facts as above except that the card issuer receives the $100 check on March 31 and the check is returned for insufficient funds on April 2. The minimum payment due on April 25 is $30. For purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 ($15), rather than the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on April 25 ($30). Thus, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)).

Section 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee based on the return of the payment on April 1.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-b-2-i-Interp-2-iv" id="52-b-2-i-Interp-2-iv">iv. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. A minimum payment of $15 is due on August 25. The card issuer receives a check for $15 on August 23, which is not returned. The card issuer receives a check for $50 on September 5, which is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds on September 7. Section 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee in these circumstances. Instead, for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on August 25 ($15). Thus, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)).</p>

Thus, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee that exceeds that amount. Nothing in §&#160;1026.52(b) permits a card issuer to impose an over-the-limit fee if imposition of the fee is inconsistent with §&#160;1026.56. The following examples illustrate the application of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) to over-the-limit fees:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-b-2-i-Interp-3-i" id="52-b-2-i-Interp-3-i">i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account with a credit limit of $5,000 begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. Assume also that, consistent with §&#160;1026.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. On March 1, the account has a $4,950 balance. On March 6, a $60 transaction is charged to the account, increasing the balance to $5,010. On March 25, a $5 transaction is charged to the account, increasing the balance to $5,015. On the last day of the billing cycle (March 31), the card issuer imposes an over-the-limit fee. For purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the March billing cycle ($15). Thus, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)).</p>

Nevertheless, for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the March billing cycle ($15). Thus, consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $15.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="52-b-2-i-Interp-4" id="52-b-2-i-Interp-4">4. <strong>Declined access check fees.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with declining payment on a check that accesses a credit card account is the amount of the check. Thus, when a check that accesses a credit card account is declined, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a fee that exceeds the amount of that check. For example, assume that a check that accesses a credit card account is used as payment for a $50 transaction, but payment on the check is declined by the card issuer because the transaction would have exceeded the credit limit for the account. For purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the declined check is the amount of the check ($50). Thus, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a fee that exceeds $50. However, the amount of this fee must also comply with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii).</p>

For example, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em>2)</em> prohibits a card issuer from imposing a $50 fee when a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is not used for at least $2,000 in purchases over the course of a year. Similarly, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em>2)</em> prohibits a card issuer from imposing a $50 annual fee on all accounts of a particular type but waiving the fee on any account that is used for at least $2,000 in purchases over the course of a year if the card issuer promotes the waiver or rebate of the annual fee for purposes of §&#160;1026.55(e). However, if the card issuer does not promote the waiver or rebate of the annual fee for purposes of §&#160;1026.55(e), §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em>2)</em> does not prohibit a card issuer from considering account activity along with other factors when deciding whether to waive or rebate annual fees on individual accounts (such as in response to a consumer's request).</p>

For example, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em>3)</em> prohibits a card issuer from:</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="52-b-2-i-Interp-7" id="52-b-2-i-Interp-7">7. <strong>Declined transaction fees.</strong> Section 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) states that card issuers must not impose a fee when there is no dollar amount associated with the violation, such as for transactions that the card issuer declines to authorize. With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in §&#160;1026.61 where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) prohibits a card issuer from imposing declined transaction fees in connection with the credit feature, regardless of whether the declined transaction fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. For example, if the prepaid card attempts to access credit from the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card and the transaction is declined, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(1) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a declined transaction fee, regardless of whether the fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Fees imposed for declining a transaction that would have only accessed the asset feature of the prepaid account and would not have accessed the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit are not covered by §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(1).</p>

If §&#160;1026.56(j)(1) permits a card issuer to impose fees for exceeding the credit limit in consecutive billing cycles based on the same over-the-limit transaction, those fees are not based on a single event or transaction for purposes of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(ii). The following examples illustrate the application of §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(ii). Assume for purposes of these examples that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="52-b-2-ii-Interp-1-i" id="52-b-2-ii-Interp-1-i">i. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 is $20. On March 26, the card issuer has not received any payment and imposes a late payment fee. Consistent with §§&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i), the card issuer may impose a $20 late payment fee on March 26. However, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an additional late payment fee if the $20 minimum payment has not been received by a subsequent date (such as March 31).</p>

This minimum payment includes the $20 minimum payment due on March 25 and the $20 late payment fee imposed on March 26. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $20 payment. No additional payments are received during the April billing cycle. Section 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee based on the consumer's failure to make the $70 required minimum periodic payment on or before April 25. Accordingly, consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) and (b)(2)(i), the card issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee on April 26.</p>

No additional payments are received during the April billing cycle. Because the card issuer has received the required minimum periodic payment due on April 25 and because §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a second late payment fee based on the consumer's failure to make the $20 minimum payment due on March 25, the card issuer cannot impose a late payment fee in these circumstances.</p>

On that same date (March 31), a $70 transaction is charged to the account, which increases the balance to $1,040. Consistent with §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 and an over-the-limit fee of $25. Section 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the imposition of both fees because those fees are based on different events or transactions. No additional transactions are charged to the account during the March, April, or May billing cycles. If the account balance remains more than $35 above the credit limit on April 26, the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), to the extent consistent with §&#160;1026.56(j)(1). Furthermore, if the account balance remains more than $35 above the credit limit on May 26, the card issuer may again impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to §&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), to the extent consistent with §&#160;1026.56(j)(1). Thereafter, §&#160;1026.56(j)(1) does not permit the card issuer to impose additional over-the-limit fees unless another over-the-limit transaction occurs.

Consistent with §§&#160;1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25 with respect to the $100 payment. However, §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction. On March 20, the card issuer receives a $120 check, which is not returned. No additional payments are received during the March billing cycle. Because the card issuer has received the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 and because §&#160;1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a second fee based on the $100 payment that was returned for insufficient funds, the card issuer cannot impose a late payment fee in these circumstances.</p>
